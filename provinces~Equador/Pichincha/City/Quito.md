> **Quito** (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈkito] ; Quechua: Kitu), officially San Francisco de Quito, 
> is the capital and second-largest city of Ecuador, 
> with an estimated population of 2.8 million in its metropolitan area. 
> It is also the capital of the province of Pichincha. 
> 
> Quito is in a valley on the eastern slopes of Pichincha, 
> an active stratovolcano in the Andes.
>
> Quito's elevation of 2,850 m (9,350 ft) 
> makes it either the highest or the second highest national capital city in the world. 
> This varied standing is because Bolivia is a country with multiple capitals; 
> if La Paz is considered the Bolivian national capital, it tops the list of highest capitals, 
> but if Sucre is specified as the capital, then it is the second highest, behind Quito.
>
> Quito is the political and cultural center of Ecuador as the country's 
> major governmental, administrative, and cultural institutions are within the city. 
> 
> The majority of transnational companies with a presence in Ecuador 
> are headquartered there. 
> It is also one of the country's two major industrial centers—
> the port city of Guayaquil being the other one.
>
> The date of its first habitation is unknown, but archaeological evidence suggests 
> that it was first settled by sedentary populations between 4400 and 1600 BC. 
> 
> In the late fifteenth century, the Inca Emperor Huayna Capac defeated the Quitu, 
> the region's original inhabitants, and incorporated Quito into the Inca Empire, 
> designating it into the capital of the Inca Empire's northern region. 
> 
> The Spanish conquest of the city in 1534 is the date most frequently cited 
> as the city's official founding, making Quito the oldest capital in South America.
>
> Quito's historic center is among the largest and best-preserved in the Americas. 
> In 1978, Quito and Kraków were the first World Cultural Heritage Sites declared by UNESCO. 
> 
> Quito is the capital city closest to the Equator, 
> which runs through the northern part of the metropolitan area in the parish of San Antonio.
